# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic page using header, main, section, article, and footer elements
- Added a Portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video
- Included accessibility features like skip link and alt text

---

## 2. Semantic decisions I made

### Decision 1
- Used <header> for introductory content at the top of the page

### Decision 2
- Used <main> to wrap the central content and added a skip link for accessibility

### Decision 3
- Used <figure> and <figcaption> to group media with captions in the portfolio section

---

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Skip link added for keyboard navigation
- Correct heading hierarchy used
- Alt text included for all images

---

## 4. What I learned
- Semantic HTML improves readability and structure

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Add real portfolio images and more content

## 6. Notes about AI usage
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- Modified manually: Personal info and section content
