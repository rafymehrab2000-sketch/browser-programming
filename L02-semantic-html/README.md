# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic page using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Added a Portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video using `<iframe>`
- Added accessibility basics: skip link, heading hierarchy, and alt text for images

---

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>` and `<h1>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: The header contains the introduction and the single h1 is the main title.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<main>` and skip link `<a href="#main">`
- Where in the page: Main content wrapper and top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: `<main>` defines the central content and skip link improves accessibility.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio media section
- Why this element is semantically correct: Figures group media with captions in a meaningful way.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link for keyboard users
- Used correct heading order (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Included alt text for all images

---

## 4. What I learned
- Semantic HTML improves structure and readability
- Accessibility features help all users

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing better alt text
- Adding more real portfolio projects

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: Base structure template
- What I modified manually: Personal details and content
