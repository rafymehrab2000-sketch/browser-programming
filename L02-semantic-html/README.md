# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic HTML page using header, main, section, article, and footer
- Added a portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video
- Added accessibility features like skip link and alt text

## 2. Semantic decisions I made

### Decision 1
I used the header element to introduce the page with my name and bio.

### Decision 2
I used the main element to wrap the central content and added a skip link.

### Decision 3
I used figure and figcaption to group media with captions.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Skip link for keyboard navigation
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images

## 4. What I learned
Semantic HTML improves structure and accessibility.

## 5. What I still need to improve
Adding more real projects and better descriptions.

## 6. Notes about AI usage
Tool used: ChatGPT
Modified manually: Personal content and details
