# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic page using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Added a Portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video using `<iframe>`
- Added accessibility basics: skip link, heading hierarchy, and alt text for images

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`, `<h1>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct: The header contains the page’s introductory content (my name and short bio) and the single `<h1>` represents the main title of the page.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<main id="main">`, `<a href="#main">Skip to content</a>`
- Where in the page: Skip link at the top; main content wrapped in `<main>`
- Why this element is semantically correct: `<main>` identifies the primary content area. The skip link improves keyboard navigation by allowing users to jump directly to the main content.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio/Works section and media items
- Why this element is semantically correct: `<section>` groups related content under a heading. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` correctly pair media (images/video) with a descriptive caption.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Included a skip link to improve keyboard navigation.
- Used correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) for screen readers.
- Added meaningful alt text to images.

---

## 4. What I learned
- Semantic HTML makes pages clearer and more accessible.
- Media should be grouped with captions using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`.

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing better alt text for complex images.
- Structuring larger pages into clear sections.

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: Initial HTML/README structure
- What I modified manually: Personal details and content
